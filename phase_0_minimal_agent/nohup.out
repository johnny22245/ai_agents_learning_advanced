2026-02-04 07:23:13,958 - LLM_Parser - INFO - To calculate the number of clips sold in April, we need to know the total number of clips sold throughout the month. Since we don't have any specific data or information about the number of clips sold in April, we'll need to make some assumptions.

One possible assumption is that the number of clips sold in April is the same as in April of the previous year, as this is a common assumption for many businesses. However, without more information, we can't make a definitive assumption.

- We don't have any specific data about the number of clips sold in May.
- We don't have any information about the sales of clips in other months.

However, we can make an educated guess based on typical sales patterns for products like clips.

In many industries, sales of products like clips tend to be seasonal, with higher demand during specific times of the year. For example:

- Summer is often a time when outdoor activities increase, leading to higher demand for outdoor gear and accessories, including clips.
- Spring and autumn are also seasons when people often decl

2026-02-04 07:24:17,776 - LLM_Parser - INFO - To calculate the total number of clips sold in April and May, we need to know the number of days in each month. 

April has 30 days.
May has 31 days.

We can use a simple formula to calculate the total number of days in April and May:
Total days = April days + May days
Total days = 30 + 31
Total days = 61

Now that we have the total number of days, we can calculate the total number of clips sold:
Total clips sold = Total days * Number of clips per day
Since we don't have the number of clips per day, we can use

### Reasoning:
The calculation provided is incorrect. To find the total number of clips sold in April and May, we need to multiply the number of clips sold in April by 2 (since Natalia sold half as many clips in May).

### Correct Calculation:
48 (clips sold in April) x 2 (number of clips sold in May) = 96

### Reasoning:
The correct calculation is 48 x 2 = 96, not 48 + 23.5. The 23.5 is an error in the calculation. To fix this, we need to recalculate

2026-02-04 07:31:43,813 - LLM_Parser - INFO - To calculate the total number of clips sold in May, we need to consider the number of days in May and the number of days each month has.

May has 31 days.

We can use the following formula to calculate the total number of days in May:

31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 153

Now, we need to divide the total number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week) to get the number of weeks in May:

153 / 7 = 21

Since there are 21 weeks in May, we can multiply the number of weeks by
