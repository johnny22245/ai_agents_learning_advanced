  "feedback": "### Evaluation\n\nStatus: False\n\nReasoning:\nThe answer provided is incorrect. It incorrectly calculates the total number of clips sold in April and May as 2 * (30x + 31x). \n\nThe correct calculation should be 2 * (30 + 31) = 2 * 61 = 122.\n\nHere's the corrected answer:\n\nThe total number of clips sold in April and May is 2 * (30 + 31) = 2 * 61 = 122x<|eot_id|>"
