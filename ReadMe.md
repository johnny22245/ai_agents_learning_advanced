# Agentic AI 

## Setup environment
Conda environment: `conda activate ai_agents`
<br>Install libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
<br> Setup a models folder and download artifacts for local LLM usage. Used LLM: `Llama 3.2 1B instruct`

## Building an agent from scratch ~ Phase 0

Check the file: `phase_0_minimal_agent`

This is implemented to show the limitations of LLMs Agent system and how things can fall apart. Next we are going to focus on following certain strategies to mitigate this with tool use, proper planning, deterministic evaluators, etc.

## Single Agent system ~ Phase 1

Upcoming:
<br>1.1 Agent state, memory & trace.
<br>1.2 Schemas and parsing contracts
<br>1.3 Verification and critic
<br>1.4 Tool Use
<br>1.5 Proper planning steps.
